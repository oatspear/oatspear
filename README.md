## Greetings! ⚔️

I am Santusk Oatspear (@oatspear).

I am interested in board and video games alike.
When I am not playing games, I am usually trying to make my own.

I am a big fan of series such as:

- Pokémon 🐶
- WarCraft 🏹
- StarCraft 👽
- Magic: the Gathering 🧙‍♂️
- Hearthstone ✨
- and many more 🎲

You may find some of my main projects below.

### Pokémon Salt Crystal

Salt Crystal is a Pokémon Crystal ROM hack that sets battles at level 50 and adds many features to the game, such as an Energy system instead of traditional Power Points (PP).

### Obminion: Battlegrounds

Obminion: Battlegrounds is a board game that is largely based on *Pokémon Duel*, *Magic: the Gathering* and *Hearthstone*.
It is being developed both as a physical game, as well as a video game.
